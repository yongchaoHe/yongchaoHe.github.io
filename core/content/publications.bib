      abstract = {Key-value stream aggregation is a common operation in distributed systems, which requires intensive computation and network resources. We propose a generic in-network aggregation service for key-value streams, ASK, to accelerate the aggregation operations in diverse distributed applications. ASK is a switch-host co-designed system, where the programmable switch provides a best-effort aggregation service, and the host runs a daemon to interact with applications. ASK makes in-depth optimization tailored to traffic characteristics, hardware restrictions, and network unreliable natures: it vectorizes multiple key-value tuples’ aggregation of one packet in one switch pipeline pass, which improves the per-host’s goodput; it develops a lightweight reliability mechanism for key-value stream’s asynchronous aggregation, which guarantees computation correctness; it designs a hot-key agnostic prioritization for key-skewed workloads, which improves the switch memory utilization. We prototype ASK and use it to support Spark and BytePS. The evaluation shows that ASK could accelerate pure key-value aggregation tasks by up to 155 times and big data jobs by 3-5 times, and be backward compatible with existing INA-empowered distributed training solutions with the same speedup.},
