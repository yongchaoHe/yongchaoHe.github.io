Welcome to Yongchao He's homepage!

I’m a researcher and engineer working on LLM systems and AI infrastructure.
I build systems that keep large models alive — and sometimes make them faster, from distributed training to LLM inference and all the little optimizations that help big things scale.

My work sits at the intersection of distributed systems, runtime design, and large-scale LLM training and inference, with a focus on system-level abstractions, performance trade-offs, and system–model co-design.

I earned my Ph.D. from the [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) (IIIS, 交叉信息研究院) at Tsinghua University, where I was advised by [Wei Xu](https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/\~weixu/) (徐葳) and [Wenfei Wu](https://wenfei-wu.github.io) (吴文斐).

Now, I lead a research & develop group focused on AI infra — exploring how to make large-scale AI systems faster, cheaper, and a little less painful.
