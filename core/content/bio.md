Welcome to my homepage!

I’m a researcher and engineer working on AI infrastructure.
I build systems that keep large models alive — and sometimes make them faster, from distributed training to LLM inference and all the little optimizations that help big things scale.

I earned my Ph.D. from the Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS) at Tsinghua University, where I was advised by [Wei Xu](https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/\~weixu/) and [Wenfei Wu](https://wenfei-wu.github.io).

Now, I lead a research & develop group focused on AI infra at a startup — exploring how to make large-scale AI systems faster, cheaper, and a little less painful.

Occasional cat wrangler, full-time system tinkerer.
Just another small node in the AI era.
