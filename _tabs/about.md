Welcome to Yongchao He’s homepage!

I’m a researcher and engineer working on AI infrastructure.
I build systems that keep large models alive — and sometimes make them faster, from distributed training to LLM inference and all the little optimizations that help big things scale.

Occasional cat wrangler, full-time system tinkerer.
Just another small node in the AI era, trying to make infrastructure a little less painful.

Cats. Code. Chaos.
Occasionally, research.
